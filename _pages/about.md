Hi, welcome to my academic webpage! I recently joined Trinity College Dublin in Spring 2025 as a faculty member in the School of Computer Science and Statistics. **I am currently looking to hire 2 x PhD students!**

My research interests are in **responsible AI**, encompassing **fairness**, **explainability** and **sustainability**. I publish in top machine learning journals (AIJ), conferences (NeurIPS, AAAI, IJCAI) and workshops. I have won two best paper awards. I also enjoy working on applied problems. I won a national award for the [Best Application of AI in a Student Project](https://twitter.com/EoinDelaney_/status/1595436264878215169) for my work on interpretable machine learning with applications in sustainable smart agriculture. I have extensive experience with deep learning and machine learning frameworks (Pytorch, Tensorflow 2.0, Tslearn, Sklearn). I also have skills in designing large scale user studies for evaluating explanations of AI systems on [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/). 

Previously, I completed my postdoc at the University of Oxford where I mainly worked on the technical side of the **Trustworthiness Auditing for AI** project with Prof. Chris Russell. We closely collaborated with Prof. Brent Mittelstadt and Prof. Sandra Wachter. At the moment I am working on building and extending [OxonFair](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4894794) which is an open-source toolkit for measuring and enforcing fairness for high-capacity models in computer vision and NLP. Update - I am happy to announce that **OxonFair has been accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Main Track!**

I obtained my Ph.D. from University College Dublin. I worked at the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) and the VistaMilk SFI research centre. My advisors were [Dr. Derek Greene](http://www.derekgreene.com/) and [Prof. Mark T. Keane](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bBozfc4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works). I also spent some time at Accenture Labs collaborating with [Christophe Gueret](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgueret/?originalSubdomain=ie) on explainable AI projects. My thesis focused on counterfactual explanations with applications in time series and computer vision. My thesis was examined by [Prof. Eamonn Keogh](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/). 

I love programming and solving interesting problems (especially the difficult ones). My background is in mathematics and physics. I also spent some wonderful time teaching these subjects at high school (Newpark Comprehensive School) and university. I am passionate about equality, diversity and inclusion and promoting computer science and mathematics to all people of all age groups! I co-designed a [website](https://maths.ucd.ie/geatamata/) for children containing lessons about various cool topics including cryptography and probability. I have experience supervising masters and visiting Ph.D. students at the University of Oxford. I also organized a workshop on AI and Accountability in St. Annes College Oxford. 

I have some capacity for consults that align with my reseach. Please reach out if this is of interest.
