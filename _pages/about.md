Hi! I am Eoin Delaney a PhD student at University College Dublin working closely with the Insight Centre for Data Analytics and the VistaMilk SFI research centre. I am advised by Dr. Derek Greene and Prof. Mark Keane. My main research interests are in Explainable AI (XAI). I am especially interested in counterfactual explanations and Case-based reasoning and the role of uncertainty in XAI. More generally I enjoy Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Time Series prediction. Outside of work related activities I enjoy travel, sports and eating good food!
