Hi! I am Eoin Delaney a PhD student at University College Dublin. I work in the Insight Centre for Data Analytics and the VistaMilk SFI research centre. My advisors are Dr. Derek Greene and Prof. Mark Keane. My main research interests are in explainable AI (XAI). I am especially interested in counterfactual explanations, case-based reasoning and the role of uncertainty in XAI. More generally I enjoy Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Time Series prediction. Outside of study, I enjoy travel, sports and eating good food!
