Hi! I am Eoin Delaney, a Ph.D. student at University College Dublin. I work in the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) and the VistaMilk SFI research centre. My advisors are [Dr. Derek Greene](http://www.derekgreene.com/) and [Prof. Mark T. Keane](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bBozfc4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works). My main research interests are in eXplainable AI (XAI). I am especially interested in counterfactual explanations, case-based reasoning and the role of uncertainty in XAI. More generally, I enjoy machine learning, deep learning and time series prediction. I have published my research in a diverse set of conferences and workshops including IJCAI and ICML. Together with my excellent collaborators, I have also won two best paper awards. Hopefully this number will increase! I have extensive experience with several deep learning and machine learning libraries (Pytorch, Tensorflow 2.0, Tslearn, Sklearn). I also have skills in designing large scale user studies for XAI on [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/) (a better alternative to Mechanical Turk). I won the [Best Application of AI in a Student Project](https://twitter.com/EoinDelaney_/status/1595436264878215169) award at the AI Ireland Awards in 2022 for my work in XAI with applications. 

In October 2023 I will be joining the University of Oxford as a Postdoctoral Researcher. I will be working on the Trustworthiness Auditing for AI project. I will be mainly working on the technical side of this project with Prof. Chris Russell. However, I will also be closely collaborating with Prof. Brent Mittelstadt and Prof. Sandra Wachter. 

### More Fun Facts
Outside of research, I enjoy travel, sport and eating good food. My profile photo is from Glacier Point in Yosemite National Park, a really cool place! I love programming and solving interesting problems. My background is in mathematics and physics. I also spent some time teaching these subjects at school and college. I am passionate about promoting computer science and mathematics to all people of all age groups! I co-designed a [website](https://maths.ucd.ie/geatamata/) for children containing lessons about various cool topics including cryptography and probability.
