Hi! I am Eoin Delaney a PhD student at University College Dublin. I work in the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) and the VistaMilk SFI research centre. My advisors are [Dr. Derek Greene](http://www.derekgreene.com/) and [Prof. Mark T. Keane](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bBozfc4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works). My main research interests are in explainable AI (XAI). I am especially interested in counterfactual explanations, case-based reasoning and the role of uncertainty in XAI. More generally, I enjoy Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Time Series prediction. 

### More Fun Facts
Outside of work, I enjoy travel and eating good food. I also really enjoy sport and frequently play 7-aside football. I love programming solving different problems, especially when working with teams of other enthusiastic people. I am passionate about education and promoting computer science and mathematics to all people of all age groups! I co-designed a [website](https://maths.ucd.ie/geatamata/) for children with lessons about various cool topics including cryptography and probability.
